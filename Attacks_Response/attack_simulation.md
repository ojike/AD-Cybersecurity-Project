# Simulating Attacks

## Common Attack Scenarios

### Phishing Attacks
1. **Simulate Phishing Attacks:**
   - Create phishing emails and test user awareness and response.
   - Use tools like GoPhish to conduct phishing simulations.

### Brute Force Attacks
1. **Simulate Brute Force Attacks:**
   - Use tools like Hydra or Medusa to simulate brute force attacks on user accounts.
   - Monitor how the system handles and logs these attempts.

### Pass-the-Hash Attacks
1. **Simulate Pass-the-Hash Attacks:**
   - Use tools like Mimikatz to simulate pass-the-hash attacks.
   - Demonstrate how attackers can use stolen hashes to access resources.

## Defense Mechanisms

### User Training
1. **Conduct Security Awareness Training:**
   - Train users to recognize phishing emails and other social engineering attacks.

### Multi-Factor Authentication
1. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
   - Use MFA to add an extra layer of security for user logins.

### Account Lockout Policies
1. **Configure Account Lockout Policies:**
   - Set account lockout thresholds to prevent brute force attacks.
