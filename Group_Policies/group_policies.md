### Creating and Linking Group Policies
1. **Create a New Group Policy Object (GPO):**
   - Open Group Policy Management.

2. **Edit the GPO:**
   - Right-click the newly created GPO and select `Edit`.
   - Configure the desired policies (e.g., security settings, software restrictions).

### Common Group Policies
1. **Security Settings:**
   - Configure password policies, account lockout policies, and audit policies.

2. **Software Restriction Policies:**
   - Define rules to restrict the execution of unauthorized software.

3. **Firewall Policies:**

4. **User Configuration:**
   - Set up policies for user desktops, start menus, and software installations.

## Advanced Group Policy Management

### Group Policy Preferences
