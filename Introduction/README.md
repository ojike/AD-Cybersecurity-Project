# Introduction

## Overview
This project demonstrates various aspects of securing and managing an Active Directory (AD) environment. It covers setup, security best practices, monitoring, attack simulations, and incident response. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide that can be used for learning and implementing AD cybersecurity measures.

## Objectives
- Set up an AD environment from scratch.
- Implement security measures to protect AD.
- Monitor and audit AD for suspicious activities.
- Simulate common attacks on AD.
- Develop an incident response plan for AD-related threats.
